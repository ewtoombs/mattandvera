`matt` and `vera` are a cute client/daemon couple. Together, they make it easy 
to stream audio across a LAN from an application on one computer to the 
speakers on another. `matt` is the daemon. It runs on the computer connected 
to the speakers. `vera` is the client. It gets started on the computer running 
the program whose audio you want transmitted across the network to the 
speakers.

Requires python, gstreamer 1 on the server end and pulseaudio on the client 
end.
